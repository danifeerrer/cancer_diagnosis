## 1. Looking at the Data

Load and examine the breast cancer dataset, check for missing values, and prepare the data for further analysis.

## 2. Visualizing the Data

Visualize the distribution of diagnosis classes and address class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

### 2.1 Scaling the Data

Scale the data to ensure features with larger magnitudes do not dominate.

## 3. Splitting the Data into Training and Testing

Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## 4. Random Forest Classifier

Utilize the Random Forest Classifier to build a predictive model.

## 5. Calculating Prediction Accuracy

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

### 5.1 F1 Score

Compute the F1 score, a measure of a model's accuracy.

### 5.2 Precision

Calculate the precision of the model.

### 5.3 Recall

Determine the recall of the model.

### 5.4 ROC Curve

Plot the ROC curve to assess the model's performance.

## 6. Extra Trees Classifier

Utilize the Extra Trees Classifier algorithm for comparison.

## 7. Calculating Prediction Accuracy

Evaluate the Extra Trees Classifier's performance and provide a classification report.
